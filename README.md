# Project-introduction
We use SDL to make a C++ language breakout clone game.
This game is mainly through two-player cooperation to eliminate cubes to get points.
Blocks will be generated at random locations within the agreed range,
and one or two blocks will be generated every time a block is cleared, 
and one point will be added until the sphere touches the upper and lower borders to show the end of the game and the score.


# How to play?

Two players control board to rebound the ball and eliminate block.

When you let the ball touch the upper and lower borders, the game over.

Press the "space" or "Enter" to start and stop game.

Player1:

-Press the "Left" and "Right" to move left and right.

 press "Up" can make the board move faster.

Player2:

-Press the "A" and "D" to move left and right.

 press "W" can make the board move faster.

# Goal 
Two players cooperate to pass and receive the ball. Keep the ball out of the line.
